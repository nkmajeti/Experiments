[evo] is a databsae migration framework targeting SQL Server, written in C# and Boo.  It is written by Ben Scheirman and published under the MIT License.  Read the LICENSE file for more details.

Use evo to script & run migrations to capture the evolutionary nature of database changes.

Usage:

==CREATING A MIGRATION==

> evo create some_migration_name

	[evo] will create a new file in the default directory, appropriately numbered in order.
 		* 0001_some_migration_name.boo	
 		
==LISTING MIGRATIONS==
 	
> evo list

	[evo] will list the migrations in the default directory, marking the one that your database is currently on
		*   0001_some_migration_name.boo
		*	0002_another_migration.boo
		*==>0003_yet_another.boo
		*	0004_my_current_migration.boo
		
[evo] looks for a file named evo.config to tell it what database to use.  You can change where it looks by supplying
the -config [file] argument.

==SPECIFYING THE DATABASE==

> evo -config config\evo.config ...
	
	[evo] will use the config file specified instead.
	
You can also explicitly set the database connection information in the command line, like so:

> evo -S localhost\SQLEXPRESS -db Foo

	[evo] will default to use Trusted Connection=true.  If you need to specify username & password, then 
	you can use the -u and -p arguments.
	
==RUNNING MIGRATIONS==

> evo run

	[evo] will execute the migrations in order, bringing you up to the latest version.
	
> evo run 12
	
	[evo] will execute the migrations in order, bringing you up to the version you specified.
	If the version is less than your current version, then the down blocks will be executed 
	to roll back until the version is reached.
	
==CREATING/DROPPING THE DATABASE==

Sometimes it's helpful to quickly create or drop a database.  This is useful as part of a larger build process.

> evo db create [dbname]	
> evo db drop [dbname]

	[evo] will connect to the server specified in the config file (or on the cmd line args).  The db argument will be ignored, because [evo] has to connect to 'master' in order to run this statement. The database will be created/dropped appropriately.
